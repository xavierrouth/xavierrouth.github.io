        <h2> C to LC3 Compiler </h2>
        <a href=https://github.com/xavierrouth/C-LC3-Compiler> github</a> 
        <p> A C Compiler that targets LC3 assembly. My introduction to compiler development and first take on a non-optimizing 
            compiler written in C. Planning on adding a full middle stage, including a custom intermediate representation and 
            various optimization passes. </p>
        <h2> NES Emulator </h2>
        <a href=https://github.com/xavierrouth/FPGA-NES> github</a> 
        <p> A NES Hardware emulator written in SystemVerilog. Developed as a team of two for my ECE 385 - Digital Systems Laboratory final project.  </p>
        <h2> Graph-Based Chess Evaluation </h2>
        <a href=https://github.com/VivenPuthenpurayil/chess-graph> github</a> 
        <p> Created a chess engine evaluation function based upon graph analysis of the position. Required implementation of various graph algorithms in C++ without assistance from outside libraries. Algorithms implemented include Tarjans’ and Brandes’ as well as Eulerian Cycle detection.   </p>
